  <h1>About Roy Giorgio</h1>
  <p><em>A lifetime of learning, flying, and building.</em></p>

  <p>
    Roy Giorgio has spent his career helping companies extend the life and reliability of their industrial equipment across
    industries ranging from mining to food processing. His passion for technology and its practical application has defined
    more than three decades of work.
  </p>

  <p>
    After majoring in Mass Communications at Western Kentucky University, Roy began his career in broadcasting, working as a
    technical leader in facilities across the U.S. His early fascination with engineering led to an Emmy Award for Outstanding
    Engineering Achievement for software that improved closed-captioning productivity nationwide.
  </p>

  <p>
    His later work in industrial reliability introduced him to the deeper meaning of keeping systems running—knowledge that now
    finds its way into every rivet and wire of his Europa project.
  </p>

  <p>
    Roy holds certifications from STLE and ICML and a private pilot’s license. He also served as a Unit Commander in the Air
    Force Auxiliary, where he participated in search and rescue and disaster relief missions.
