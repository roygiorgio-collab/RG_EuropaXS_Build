  <h1>How It Started</h1>
  <p><em>A few thoughts from the builder’s bench.</em></p>

  <p>
    My brother Frank and I grew up building and flying model airplanes. He was the builder; I was the pilot.
    We lost more than a few aircraft thanks to the radio gear we were using—RC car receivers and servos that
    didn’t exactly have stellar range.
  </p>

  <p>
    Frank went on to become an A&P mechanic for Delta and later ran his own business refurbishing aircraft interiors.
    When I started my flight training, he was the one I expected to be helping me through a real airplane build someday.
    Even though he passed away far too young, I still “consult” with him in my head—asking how he’d tackle something.
    If it turns out wrong, well… I blame him.
  </p>

  <p>
    My first career in broadcasting introduced me to electronics, and my second career taught me the meaning of reliability.
    Both have come in handy here. I’ve already built and tested a custom logic controller for the lights—let’s just say the
    wig-wag pattern will be hard to miss.
  </p>

  <p>
    My flight instructor, Skip Stewart, put me through the wringer back in the ’90s. After my first solo, he asked,
    “Did you hoot?” I embarrassingly giggled and said yes. He grinned and said, “Good. That means you love it, and you’ll finish.”
    That feeling is what I’m chasing again—when I lift off for the first time in a plane I built myself.
  </p>

  <p>
    Over the years, I’ve also seen why owning your own airplane can be a necessity if you really want reliability.
    Rental aircraft too often came with scheduling frustrations or questionable maintenance. Once, after multiple
    “no trouble found” shop visits, a Civil Air Patrol 172 I was flying nearly shook itself apart during a run-up.
    The next mechanic found a faulty fuel servo that had been there since the plane left the factory—and he’d never
    seen spark plugs fouled that badly from running rich.
