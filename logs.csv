It landed on the extended corner where it had not yet been reinforced. It actually broke the fiberglass and not the joint.

922786E9-11F6-4BCE-BDDB-0354D1F432D1,"Left Horizontal Stabilizer","Trim Tab Extension ","For some reason, the trim tab for the left stabilizer was about a quarter of an inch shorter than the right trim Tab. I have looked at several examples and everyone else has them equidistant from the fuselage. Unfortunately, I couldnâ€™t send the right one down enough to match so I extended the Tab since it was such a small amount, I did not want to do a layup to build up extra weight. I took a Dremel tool and cut several small slots that did not penetrate all the way through. I then had matching slots on the piece of premade panel and filled them with flocks. Looks like Frankensteinâ€˜s monsterâ€¦",2025-09-12,3600,"Work Log","",1,0

It turned out well. I used a Wagner power painter with the stain nozzle and it worked out very well. Not a very large pattern, but it was quite itemized and made a smooth finish.

Also, I donâ€™t know if I have the covers from the factory and cannot find images of one. Iâ€™ve decided to make a perfectly round hole and then I will actually use a piece of carbon fiber to cut a circle that will fill the hole and be able to seal below it. I will utilize a bar below it so that I can take a screwdriver and tighten it. wish me luck that the plastic cup with a bit of release agent on it actually comes out.ðŸ˜…",2025-08-24,5400,"Work Log","",2,0

There was still quite a bit of bumps that I could feel from the peel ply. I decided to do a second slurry coat before trying to fill any of the low spots. Plus, I sanded the top side, which took about an hour and a half. The bottom half required two separate batches of slurry to get smooth and everything covered.",2025-08-21,9000,"Work Log","",1,0

I try to technique to spread it thinly but smoothly. Obviously, I did not succeed. You can see after sanding that there are many, many low spots. I knew there would be some problems on the edge where I ran out of micro, but wanted to get this coat sanded before adding more. The dark spots are from the guide coat.",2025-08-19,3600,"Work Log","",1,0

However, it looks like he realized he was about 1/4 inch off from the leading edge and was going to be 1/8 inch off in the opposite direction at the trailing edge. He did not break the fiberglass completely at the end, but there was a gap. I filled the gap with flox and clamped it. I will add strips of bid after that cures.",2025-08-06,1800,"Work Log","",1,0
FC13B91C-9226-4144-9D0F-A16EFC26C397,"Right horizontal stabilizer","Initial Fitting Of Both Horizontal Stabs","Quite a bit of polishing and lining on both horizontal stabilizers to attach them to the torque tube. The torque tube has to be slightly reworked. There is a modification to clamp the components rather than rely on pins. The pins have a tendency to wallow out and develop some play.
There is a cut on the right stabilizer that now has to be reinforced. Apparently there was a miss measurement and someone started trimming before fitting properly. I will lay up some bid underneath to reinforce as well as fill the void from the sawblade with with flox.",2025-08-05,7200,"Work Log","",5,0

06E963D5-CBC9-4CCD-8D85-E96749E908AC,"Left Horizontal Stabilizer","Final Sanding","I was able to sand both sides down to what I believe to be a level adequate for a finish. I found that wet sanding with 220 in a very light touch took off adequate amounts. I then followed up with 400 to give it a smooth finish. It did expose some of the micro filler that I had put on. However, (and you might think Iâ€™m crazyâ€¦ ) but I am going to put the first coat of white paint on utilizing Krylon Fusion.  It does not require a primer. This way, I will be able to see progress and not have to stress the hinges if I decided to paint it after it was assembled.  I will decide later if I am going to use a two-part polyurethane for the second coat of white. I will definitely use a two part polyurethane clear topcoat to protect whatever I put on there.

Switched to wet sanding which seems to work well.  Spent a good portion on the end of the stabilizer trying to figure out if it was a smooth hump or a reflection.
I have to admit, itâ€™s a little disappointing to think you have got it smooth enough for primer and then when you sand the primer you realize how bumpy it wasâ€¦ I figured I would have a few few areas to touch up, but Iâ€™m only a fourth of the way through .",2025-07-22,14400,"Achievement","",1,0

I found that going out to the driveway, setting the work piece on saw horses with a foam mount to stabilize the piece and using a blower sitting on a stool next to the piece made it very efficient.  The blower would blow off any dust into the yard and I didnâ€™t even have to wear a mask.  The dust doesnâ€™t build up under the sandpaper increasing efficiency.",2025-07-21,900,"Advice","",0,0
ABBFD865-1567-4882-9DCD-115FAEB63A84,"Left Horizontal Stabilizer","Left Stabilator Layups and alignment","Verification of all of the layups and proper hole positions. There was a defect or dent in the TP5 sleeve in the 2 o'clock position abut 2.5 inches in. While only about 2/1000, it was enough to cause the TP4 tube to bind when trying to insert. The defect was a small pocket of a crystalline type substance... maybe a pieced of embedded sand. It was scratching the tube. It took several attempts to dig it out with dental picks and some light sanding and polishing.",2025-06-18,14400,"Work Log","",0,0
2B9C4AA6-3A0A-4718-B12A-83BE6E17E430,"Rudder CBM 02","Rudder Work","The rudder is the first project. Since the original layup work was completed, I disassembled the rudder horn, treated it with clear coat to prevent rust. I have since decided I will paint it and all ferrous pieces a flat gray. While the layups looked good before attempting to primer, it turns out there were several low spots that had to be built up with micro. This was a bit tedious but it was a good confidence builder. I was probably being way too cautious with the sanding when I started but found several methods to accelerate the process. I still have a small amount of low spots to fill but will wait until I have started the next surface since I would have to mix a whole batch for what will probably be less than a tablespoon of filler needed. The $250 allocated to this included the cost of the sandpaper, sanding blocks and a handy system from Eastwood that allows me to sand in the garage without any dust. It attaches to the vacuum cleaner and collects the dust through holes in the sandpaper.",2025-06-14,50400,"Work Log","CBM 02",3,0

The cradle is made from 2x4 and 2x6 lumber with casters from Amazon. The casters have locking brakes. The top half of the fuselage is suspended from the ceiling with a kayak lift system. Scrap from the cradle was used to build a support for the front half and four suction cups were epoxied on the rear to support the tail. There are safety straps in the event of a failure of one of the cups. This will allow it to not only be out of the way but also make it much easier during the fitting/trimming process.",2025-05-12,36000,"Work Log","",4,0
