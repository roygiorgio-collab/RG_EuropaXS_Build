  <h1>Why the Europa</h1>

  <p>Over the years, I’ve flirted with a few other kits. I started building a KR-2 Stretch, and I even bought plans for a Tandem Airbike. The KR promised speed and simplicity, but after visiting several KR Gatherings, it became clear that few actually met their published numbers—usually thanks to deviations from the plans. And with three overlapping plan sets (KR-1, KR-2, and the stretched version), I found myself cross-referencing diagrams like a codebreaker. By the time I made my third construction error, I realized I was doing more repairing than building. The Airbike plans weren’t much better—let’s just say “missing dimensions” is a tough place to start.</p>

  <p>When retirement started coming into view, I decided it was time to chase the dream properly. I wrote down my goals:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>At least two seats</li>
    <li>125+ knot cruise speed</li>
    <li>500+ pound useful load</li>
    <li>&lt;6 GPH fuel burn</li>
    <li>Folding or removable wings</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The Arion Lightning was a strong contender—it’s fast, efficient, and built right here in Tennessee—but it lacks folding wings, and hangar space around here is both scarce and pricey. I refuse to keep an airplane outside.</p>

  <p>The Kitfox Speedster checked most boxes but was a bit slower and had a 14-month wait for a kit. I even planned a trip with my son to visit the factory.</p>

  <p>Then one day, just for fun, I checked Barnstormers. There it was: an unfinished Europa XS for about a third of the cost of a new kit. It checked every box. Better yet, it was located just an hour from where I was headed three weeks later. When I inspected it, I found the work already completed was meticulous. I like to think fate had a hand in it—because the Europa really is the perfect fit.</p>

  <p>Finding the right project was only half the battle. Once I decided on the Europa, I also made a commitment to how I was going to build it. I’ve seen too many great designs end up looking like patchwork quilts because the builder got impatient near the end. I promised myself early on that this airplane would be built carefully, thoughtfully, and maybe just a little obsessively.</p>
