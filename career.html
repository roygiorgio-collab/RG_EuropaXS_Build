  <h1>Career</h1>

  <p>Before I started sanding fiberglass and learning how to mix epoxy just right, my career revolved around helping people get the most out of their machines. I spent decades working across industries like mining, manufacturing, and food processing, helping companies improve equipment reliability and make things last longer.</p>

  <p>Technology and problem-solving have always been my fuel. Over the years, I’ve had the chance to work with organizations like Cummins, Mobil, Chevron, and Komatsu—helping them use new and emerging technologies to boost reliability and efficiency. It’s the kind of work that teaches you how machines think (and misbehave).</p>

  <p>Before all that, I worked in broadcast engineering, where I learned that a soldering iron, a bit of patience, and a creative workaround can fix just about anything. I was even lucky enough to pick up an Emmy Award for Outstanding Engineering Achievement for developing software that sped up the process of closed captioning and set a national standard for the industry.</p>

  <p>Somewhere along the way, I added a few letters after my name—CLS, OMA I, MLT I, MLA II—through STLE and ICML certifications. They taught me a lot about reliability, failure modes, and what makes complex systems stay healthy. Turns out, that knowledge translates pretty nicely from factory floors to airplane hangars.</p>

  <p>I also hold a private pilot’s license and served as a Unit Commander in the Air Force Auxiliary, flying search and rescue missions and helping with disaster relief. That mix of hands-on engineering, reliability work, and love of aviation all led me here—to the Europa project and the smell of curing epoxy that now seems to follow me everywhere.</p>
