  <h1>Building Philosophy</h1>

  <p>I’m approaching this project a little differently than most builders. Too often, I see where someone starts an airplane, and by the time they get to paint, they’re so eager to fly that they start cutting corners. I once saw an amphibious airplane at an EAA gathering that looked like someone had slapped fiberglass on the nose with duct tape and said, “Good enough!” I’ve seen others with paint runs and rough seams that made me wonder if they ran out of sandpaper or patience first.</p>

  <p>The way I see it, when a non-mechanical person walks up to an airplane, they’re going to judge its airworthiness by its appearance. Now, good paint and smooth fiberglass don’t make it fly any safer—but they do help passengers relax. Nobody wants to strap into something that looks like it’s held together with leftover Bondo and hope. So I’m taking my time with the finishing work. As of this writing, I’ve logged about 75 hours of filling, sanding, and smoothing, and I can already see how tempting it would be to skip the tedious stuff once that first taxi test starts calling your name.</p>

  <p>Even though my kit was partially completed when I bought it—and the previous builder’s work was excellent—I take nothing for granted. Every piece gets checked, measured, and dry-fit before I move on. I’ve already found a couple of small mistakes (you can see where these are documented in the Trim Tab and Right Horizontal Stabilizer sections), and it just reinforces my philosophy: if I didn’t do it myself, it’s getting verified.</p>

  <p>For power, I plan to install an engine from Aeromomentum. They’ve been building airboat engines for over 30 years and aircraft engines for about a decade. Their designs are based on automotive engine blocks, but unlike some so-called “conversions” that are basically car engines with a prop bolted on, Aeromomentum’s setups are properly engineered. The fuel-injected ECU system means I get modern reliability—because honestly, when was the last time your car had a fuel injection issue? I’ve had more trouble with certified aircraft engines than I’ve ever had with anything under the hood of a car.</p>

  <p>All control surfaces and systems will be built exactly by the book. Ivan Shaw knew what he was doing, and from everything I’ve read, the controls are beautifully balanced and the handling is excellent. I’ll happily let his expertise guide me.</p>

  <p>Yes, there are days when progress feels slower than waiting for epoxy to cure—but then there are those days when something clicks perfectly into place, and you walk away grinning. As long as I’m moving forward, I’m content. The goal isn’t to rush to the finish line—it’s to enjoy the build, learn something new, and end up with a plane I can be proud of both inside and out.</p>
