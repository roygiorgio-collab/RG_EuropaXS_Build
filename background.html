  <h1>Background & Inspiration</h1>

  <p>My love of aviation started long before I ever set foot in a real cockpit. My brother Frank and I used to build and fly model airplanes—he was the builder, and I was the pilot. We lost more than a few because we used radio gear meant for RC cars, and the range wasn’t exactly... adequate. Let’s just say there’s still some of our handiwork scattered in the fields of Kentucky.</p>

  <p>Frank went on to become an A&amp;P for Delta and later ran his own business refurbishing aircraft interiors before passing away far too young at 47. In my mind, he was always supposed to be part of this build—and in a way, he still is. I sometimes catch myself asking him how he’d do something. If it turns out wrong, I just blame him.</p>

  <p>My first career in broadcasting introduced me to electronics. Working alongside RF engineers and programmers gave me an appreciation for both precision and creativity—skills that come in handy here. I’ve already designed and tested a custom logic controller for the aircraft’s lighting system. Let’s just say the wig-wag pattern and random flash are going to get some attention on short final.</p>

  <p>My second career introduced me to the world of reliability. I had the privilege of working with some of the best reliability engineers around the world, learning how to make machines last longer and perform better. One lesson that stuck: simplicity usually wins. That’s why my battery selector will likely be a marine switch—lighter than two relays and, in all my years of boating, I’ve never seen one fail.</p>

  <p>Skip Stewart—my instructor—once asked me after my first solo if I “hooted.” I embarrassingly giggled and said yes. He smiled and said, “Good. That tells me you love flying, and you’re going to finish.” I want to feel that same mix of joy and disbelief when I take off for the first time in a plane I built myself.</p>

  <p>A couple of frustrations also nudged me toward building. Renting planes got harder—fleets changed, checkouts multiplied, and the one you reserved was often grounded, damaged, or overdue for maintenance. And while there are plenty of talented A&amp;Ps out there, I’ve also seen the other kind. Once, a Civil Air Patrol C172 I flew was sent to the same shop three times for a fuel issue, always returning with “no problem found.” During a run-up, the right mag made the engine feel like it was about to shake itself loose. A second shop finally found a fuel servo defect that had been there since the day the airplane left the factory. They said they’d never seen spark plugs that fouled so completely from running rich for so long. That experience left me wanting to know every nut, bolt, and servo on my own airplane.</p>
