When I was creating the bushings to go into the trim tab T-Bar, a couple of them were obviously drilled slightly off center. I thought I would hang onto them for an emergency… But it turns out they came in handy. Although I had checked previously, when I was attempting the final alignment, I could see that the left trim Tab was about a half a degree higher than the right. I took the two bushings that were slightly off-center and oriented them appropriately in the T-bar so that the left one would go down a little and the right one would go up. I was then able to adjust the overall length to create perfect alignment. I wasn’t sure how I was going to do it otherwise unless I bent the tube.  I still have some trimming to do on the fuselage. I am only able to raise the elevator 10.5° and need to make it to 12. Looks like I have my work cut out for tomorrow.",

    "summary" : "It was very tedious, getting the first piece of glass in through the hole. I had already laid up the flox on the edge just to give it a somewhat level playing field. After I had it stippled in place and was about to add the second piece, I remembered the technique that I saw in a dental video that I had edited. So I rolled the part that had to go the furthest back about an inch and then from the sides folded that in half. When I laid it in there and then unrolled it, it was perfectly placed. I stippled it in making sure no air bubbles. I thought I had some peel ply, but was mistaken. So I took kitchen wrap and laid it on the fiberglass and taped it into place so that there were no wrinkles. Then took a silicone baking mat and sat on top of that with a small can of paint for weight. That should turn out just fine.",

I’m using that on the inside instead of hanging it upside down on the actual steel pipe. I’ve also treated the nylon with a silicone release agent.\nIf there is going to be any purpose of this, I have to do it slightly differently. I fashioned a foam piece to fit over the nylon bushing so that if this ever is used to prevent separation from the airplane. I had to build a ramp.

    "summary" : "I hit a snag… When I tightened the first clamp on the right stabilizer sleeve, the whole mechanism started binding again.  At first, I thought the clamp was causing the outer sleeve to form in an oval shape. However, with both clamps in and only finger tight, the binding was still there. It turns out the right brass bushing was very slightly misaligned. To confirm, I literally only had to take my left hand and slightly twist the fuselage near the shaft to make it unbind. I put a 0.001 shim under the right sleeve on the front to cant it very slightly. This reduced the resistance to almost nothing. This slowed me down for several days waiting for the shim to come in and to take care of some family stuff. I was sweating bullets to see the final outcome of getting all eight clamps in position and torqued down. I was very relieved to see that there was virtually no binding when I got all the clamps in.\nI used an inexpensive borescope and a parts grabber to install the bolts from the inside. Once I figured out the technique, it wasn’t really all that bad but, yes, it was tedious. I also had to grind one thread down on the end of the 1 inch bolt to get the second screw at each point to make the turn through the hole. A three-quarter inch bolt went through very easily, but only left me with about one and a half to 2 threads when torqued down. I needed most of the 1 inch bolt to have enough to make sure I could torque it down and have clean threads.  Each of the saddle washers had to be fit for its specific location to allow clearance for welds and rounded corners to fit inside the nylon sleeves. all were installed with Loctite Blue 243 and torqued to 9 ft-lb except the front right stabilzer.  It caused a distortion of the tube and caused binding.  It was torqued to 6 ft-lb.",

I used 100% silicone that appears to be about an ISO 320 viscosity. It’s actually labeled treadmill lubricant but it’s still 100% silicone and the viscosity I want. I wanted to use this instead of grease so that I could put a little sponge reservoir on top of the nylon later to ensure there’s constant lubrication. It seems to be fitting with an appropriate amount of “snugness.” There is no play from side to side and no resistance to the rotation. Only a small amount of force was required to fit the saddle washers in the nylon sleeves.\nUnfortunately, this is where I found the bushing out of alignment. I marked each sleeve with a sharpie and then reinstalled it. It showed me where it was rubbing. I was able to take a Dremel tool and just a polishing wheel to remove enough material to free it up. I doubt I took even 1000th of an inch. I literally just polished it to shiny twice.",

Spent a good portion on the end of the stabilizer trying to figure out if it was a smooth hump or a reflection.\nI have to admit, it’s a little disappointing to think you have got it smooth enough for primer and then when you sand the primer you realize how bumpy it was… I figured I would have a few few areas to touch up, but I’m only a fourth of the way through .",

I found that going out to the driveway, setting the work piece on saw horses with a foam mount to stabilize the piece and using a blower sitting on a stool next to the piece made it very efficient.  The blower would blow off any dust into the yard and I didn’t even have to wear a mask.  The dust doesn’t build up under the sandpaper increasing efficiency.",

    "summary" : "The rudder is the first project. Since the original layup work was completed, I disassembled the rudder horn, treated it with clear coat to prevent rust. I have since decided I will paint it and all ferrous pieces a flat gray. While the layups looked good before attempting to primer, it turns out there were several low spots that had to be built up with micro. This was a bit tedious but it was a good confidence builder. I was probably being way too cautious with the sanding when I started but found several methods to accelerate the process. I still have a small amount of low spots to fill but will wait until I have started the next surface since I would have to mix a whole batch for what will probably be less than a tablespoon of filler needed. The $250 allocated to this included the cost of the sandpaper, sanding blocks and a handy system from Eastwood that allows me to sand in the garage without any dust. It attaches to the vacuum cleaner and collects the dust through holes in the sandpaper. (The following was added 11\/5\/25)  I had been documenting using the free EAA builders log but it was just too cumbersome.  I switched to KitFlight and it’s piece of cake using my phone to take photos and add captions as well as work completed. Much, much easier.",

The casters have locking brakes. The top half of the fuselage is suspended from the ceiling with a kayak lift system. Scrap from the cradle was used to build a support for the front half and four suction cups were epoxied on the rear to support the tail. There are safety straps in the event of a failure of one of the cups. This will allow it to not only be out of the way but also make it much easier during the fitting\/trimming process.",
