    "summary" : "I hit a snag… When I tightened the first clamp on the right stabilizer sleeve, the whole mechanism started binding again.  At first, I thought the clamp was causing the outer sleeve to form in an oval shape. However, with both clamps in and only finger tight, the binding was still there. It turns out the right brass bushing was very slightly misaligned. To confirm, I literally only had to take my left hand and slightly twist the fuselage near the shaft to make it unbind. I put a 0.001 shim under the right sleeve on the front to cant it very slightly. This reduced the resistance to almost nothing. This slowed me down for several days waiting for the shim to come in and to take care of some family stuff. I was sweating bullets to see the final outcome of getting all eight clamps in position and torqued down. I was very relieved to see that there was virtually no binding when I got all the clamps in.\nI used an inexpensive borescope and a parts grabber to install the bolts from the inside. Once I figured out the technique, it wasn’t really all that bad but, yes, it was tedious. I also had to grind one thread down on the end of the 1 inch bolt to get the second screw at each point to make the turn through the hole. A three-quarter inch bolt went through very easily, but only left me with about one and a half to 2 threads when torqued down. I needed most of the 1 inch bolt to have enough to make sure I could torque it down and have clean threads.  Each of the saddle washers had to be fit for its specific location to allow clearance for welds and rounded corners to fit inside the nylon sleeves. all were installed with Loctite Blue 243 and torqued to 9 ft-lb except the front right stabilzer.  It caused a distortion of the tube and caused binding.  It was torqued to 6 ft-lb.",

    "summary" : "I used acetone and a lint free cloth to clean the brass bushings and also clean the outside of the bearing surface of the elevator flanges. I used 100% silicone that appears to be about an ISO 320 viscosity. It’s actually labeled treadmill lubricant but it’s still 100% silicone and the viscosity I want. I wanted to use this instead of grease so that I could put a little sponge reservoir on top of the nylon later to ensure there’s constant lubrication. It seems to be fitting with an appropriate amount of “snugness.” There is no play from side to side and no resistance to the rotation. Only a small amount of force was required to fit the saddle washers in the nylon sleeves.\nUnfortunately, this is where I found the bushing out of alignment. I marked each sleeve with a sharpie and then reinstalled it. It showed me where it was rubbing. I was able to take a Dremel tool and just a polishing wheel to remove enough material to free it up. I doubt I took even 1000th of an inch. I literally just polished it to shiny twice.",

    "summary" : "I was able to sand both sides down to what I believe to be a level adequate for a finish. I found that wet sanding with 220 in a very light touch took off adequate amounts. I then followed up with 400 to give it a smooth finish. It did expose some of the micro filler that I had put on. However, (and you might think I’m crazy… ) but I am going to put the first coat of white paint on utilizing Krylon Fusion.  It does not require a primer. This way, I will be able to see progress and not have to stress the hinges if I decided to paint it after it was assembled.  I will decide later if I am going to use a two-part polyurethane for the second coat of white. I will definitely use a two part polyurethane clear topcoat to protect whatever I put on there. ",

I found that going out to the driveway, setting the work piece on saw horses with a foam mount to stabilize the piece and using a blower sitting on a stool next to the piece made it very efficient.  The blower would blow off any dust into the yard and I didn’t even have to wear a mask.  The dust doesn’t build up under the sandpaper increasing efficiency.",

    "summary" : "The rudder is the first project. Since the original layup work was completed, I disassembled the rudder horn, treated it with clear coat to prevent rust. I have since decided I will paint it and all ferrous pieces a flat gray. While the layups looked good before attempting to primer, it turns out there were several low spots that had to be built up with micro. This was a bit tedious but it was a good confidence builder. I was probably being way too cautious with the sanding when I started but found several methods to accelerate the process. I still have a small amount of low spots to fill but will wait until I have started the next surface since I would have to mix a whole batch for what will probably be less than a tablespoon of filler needed. The $250 allocated to this included the cost of the sandpaper, sanding blocks and a handy system from Eastwood that allows me to sand in the garage without any dust. It attaches to the vacuum cleaner and collects the dust through holes in the sandpaper.",
