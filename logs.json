    "summary" : "I hit a snagâ€¦ When I tightened the first clamp on the right stabilizer sleeve, the whole mechanism started binding.  At first, I thought the clamp was causing the outer sleeve to form in an oval shape. However, with both clamps in and only finger tight, the binding was still there. It turns out the right brass bushing was very slightly misaligned. To confirm, I literally only had to take my left hand and slightly twist the fuselage near the shaft to make it unbind. I put a 0.001 shim under the right sleeve on the front to cant it very slightly. This reduced the resistance to almost nothing. This slowed me down for several days waiting for the shim to come in and to take care of some family stuff. I was sweating bullets to see the final outcome of getting all eight clamps in position and torqued down. I was very relieved to see that there was virtually no binding when I got all the clamps in.\nI used an inexpensive borescope and a parts grabber to install the bolts from the inside. Once I figured out the technique, it wasnâ€™t really all that bad but, yes, it was tedious. I also had to grind one thread down on the end of the 1 inch bolt to get the second screw at each point to make the turn through the hole. A three-quarter inch bolt went through very easily, but only left me with about one and a half to 2 threads when torque down. I needed most of the 1 inch bolt to have enough to make sure I could torque it down and have clean threads.  Each of the saddle washers had to be fit for its specific location to allow clearance for welds and rounded corners to fit inside the nylon sleeves.",

I wanted to use this instead of grease so that I could put a little sponge reservoir on top of the nylon later to ensure thereâ€™s constant lubrication. It seems to be fitting an appropriate amount of â€œsnugnessâ€, and there is no play from side to side and no resistance to the rotation.

I have since decided I will paint it and all ferrous pieces a flat gray. While the layups looked good before attempting to primer, it turns out there were several low spots that had to be built up with micro. This was a bit tedious but it was a good confidence builder. I was probably being way too cautious with the sanding when I started but found several methods to accelerate the process. I still have a small amount of low spots to fill but will wait until I have started the next surface since I would have to mix a whole batch for what will probably be less than a tablespoon of filler needed. The $250 allocated to this included the cost of the sandpaper, sanding blocks and a handy system from Eastwood that allows me to sand in the garage without any dust. It attaches to the vacuum cleaner and collects the dust through holes in the sandpaper.",
