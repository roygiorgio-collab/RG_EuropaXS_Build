  <h1>Why the Europa</h1>
  <p><em>The airplane that checked all the boxes.</em></p>

  <p>
    I’d looked at several designs over the years—starting a KR-2 Stretch, and even buying plans for a Tandem Air Bike.
    Both had their charm, but they also came with baggage. The KR plans were a patchwork of revisions that required
    cross-referencing three different manuals. After the third correction on a not-yet-finished airframe, I decided
    it wasn’t the right project.

    As retirement approached, I set my criteria: at least two seats, 125+ knot cruise, 500-pound useful load,
    under 6 GPH fuel burn, and removable or folding wings. The Arion Lightning came close, but it couldn’t fold.
    The Kitfox Speedster was tempting, but slow—and there was a long wait for kits.
  </p>

    One night, while poking around on Barnstormers, I spotted an unfinished Europa XS at about a third of the new-kit price.
    It ticked every box on my list, and the timing was uncanny. The seller was located just an hour away from where I was
    headed three weeks later. When I inspected it, the workmanship was meticulous. Fate, it seemed, had handed me the right airplane.
