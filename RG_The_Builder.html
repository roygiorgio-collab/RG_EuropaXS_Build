  <h1>About This Build</h1>

  <p>My name is Roy Giorgio, and this site chronicles the construction of my Europa XS, a two-seat composite aircraft that’s been on the short list since the 1990's.</p>

  <p>A lifelong fascination with aviation began back near Fort Knox, Kentucky, where summer afternoons were spent watching helicopters train alongside tanks on the firing range. That early curiosity eventually led me to earn my pilot’s license in the mid-1990s, flying out of Smyrna, Tennessee with instructor Skip Stewart—yes, that <a href="https://youtu.be/YbkTeoUfv54" target="_blank">Skip Stewart</a> of aerobatic fame. Skip put me through the wringer, and while I’ve never had the urge to hang from the prop, I did learn to respect what an airplane can do when properly handled.</p>

  <p>My wife Karen has been my quiet co-pilot through all of it. She’s the one who figured out how to finance my flying lessons when money was tight, and the “724KS” registration number for this aircraft reflects both our anniversary and her initials—a small tribute to her encouragement (and her remarkable tolerance for the noises, smells, and dust drifting out of the garage).</p>

  <p>This project blends two lifelong threads: a passion for aviation and a career spent helping people understand how machines live, breathe, and last. It’s part education, part therapy, and part obsession.</p>
