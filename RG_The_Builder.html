    <h2 style="font-size: 1.4em; color: #4a4036;">Why I’m Building an Airplane</h2>
    <p>When I was a kid, my brother Skip took me up in his homebuilt EAA Biplane. The moment the wheels left the ground, I felt something I’ve never forgotten. I want to feel that same sense of elation when I fly a plane that I built with my own hands.</p>

    <p>Of course, there are some more “practical” motivations too. Renting planes can be a pain — fleets change, checkouts multiply, and sometimes the airplane you reserved gets grounded for maintenance or worse, dented by the last pilot. And while there are plenty of talented A&Ps out there, I’ve also had experiences that make me want to be responsible for my own aircraft. Once, a Civil Air Patrol C172 went into the shop three times for a fuel issue. Each time it came back with “no problem found.” On the third attempt, I embarrassedly giggled when the engine nearly shook itself apart during a mag check. Another shop finally discovered a defect in the fuel servo that had been there since the airplane left the factory — and said they’d never seen spark plugs so fouled from constantly running rich. That experience cemented my desire to build and maintain my own airplane.</p>

    <h2 style="font-size: 1.4em; color: #4a4036;">Choosing the Europa</h2>
    <p>I’ve looked at several aircraft over the years — even started building a KR2 Stretch and bought plans for a Tandem Airbike. The KR was simple and advertised as fast, but reality didn’t match the hype. After visiting KR gatherings, I learned most builders didn’t hit the published numbers, usually due to design deviations (or, let’s say, “creative craftsmanship”). The KR-2S plans also felt like juggling three different instruction manuals, and after fixing my third mistake before even finishing, I decided my project wasn’t airworthy.</p>

    <p>The Tandem Airbike had potential, but the plans were more like loose suggestions. The metal airframe was no longer available, which didn’t help.</p>

    <p>As retirement neared, I revisited my lifelong dream of building an airplane — this time with clear objectives: two seats, at least 125 knots cruise, a 500-pound useful load, less than 6 GPH at cruise, and folding or removable wings. I loved the Arion Lightning (built right here in Tennessee), but it lacked folding wings. Hangar space is scarce and expensive, and I refuse to keep an airplane outside. The Kitfox Speedster was appealing but a little slow — and had a 14-month waiting list.</p>

    <p>Just for grins, I browsed Barnstormers and saw an unfinished Europa XS listed for about one-third the cost of a new kit. It felt like fate. Even better, it was only an hour from where I’d be in a few weeks. The work already done was meticulous, and the Europa checked every box on my list. So, I guess you could say this project is a happy collision of research, timing, and a dash of serendipity.</p>

    <h2 style="font-size: 1.4em; color: #4a4036;">The Build Philosophy</h2>
    <p>I’m taking a slightly different approach than most builders. Too often, I see aircraft finished in a rush — fiberglass that looks like it was applied with duct tape, or paint that’s clearly fighting gravity. While looks don’t guarantee airworthiness, they do inspire confidence. A sloppy finish can make people wonder, “If it looks like that on the outside, what’s it like inside?”</p>

    <p>That’s why I’m tackling much of the fiberglass filling and finishing early, before diving deep into the mechanical systems. I’m following the manual, but adding my finishing work as I go. As of this writing, I’ve logged about 75 hours of finish work. It’s easy to see how builders could lose patience near the end, but I’m determined not to cut corners.</p>

    <p>Even though my kit’s early work looks great, I take nothing for granted. I’m verifying everything and completing all the recommended modifications. I’ve found two small errors so far — you can see where these are documented in the Trim Tab and Right Horizontal Stabilizer sections.</p>

    <p>My plan is to use an Aeromomentum engine — based on a modern automotive block and fuel injected with an ECU. They’ve built airboat engines for decades and branched into aviation about ten years ago. I like that it’s a well-thought-out conversion, not just a car engine with a propeller stuck on it. Honestly, who’s had an injection issue on a car in the last 30 years? Meanwhile, I’ve had plenty of “fun” with aircraft engines that were supposedly bulletproof.</p>

    <p>All control surfaces and systems will be built exactly per plans. Ivan Shaw knew what he was doing, and I have no interest in redesigning an airplane that already flies beautifully. There are definitely days when progress feels slow, but as long as there’s forward movement — even while waiting for epoxy to cure — I’m happy.</p>

    <h2 style="font-size: 1.4em; color: #4a4036;">About Roy</h2>
    <p>I spent my career in broadcasting and later in communications, working alongside some remarkable engineers and creative teams. I’ve always loved solving problems — whether it was keeping a television station on the air or figuring out how to make a landing gear bracket fit perfectly. Building this airplane combines everything I enjoy: problem-solving, craftsmanship, and a bit of storytelling along the way.</p>

    <p>My wife, Karen, deserves special recognition for her patience — and her tolerance of the noises, smells, and dust coming from the garage. She’s learned that if something smells funny or sounds like a jet engine in the driveway, it probably means progress.</p>
