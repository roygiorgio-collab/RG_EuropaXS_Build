  <h1>The Build Approach</h1>
  <p><em>Patience, epoxy, and a touch of humor.</em></p>

  <p>
    I’m approaching this build a little differently than most. Too often, builders rush the finish work once the end is in sight.
    I’ve seen airplanes that looked like fiberglass was slapped on with masking tape and painted before lunch.
    My philosophy is simple: people judge mechanical integrity by appearance, even if it’s not fair.
  </p>

    To me, if someone sees a neat, smooth exterior, they’ll think, “This builder cared about the details.” So, I’m doing
    as much filling and sanding as possible now, before the heavy mechanical work begins. As of this writing, I’ve logged
    about 75 hours of finish work—and I understand why some skip it. But I’d rather wait for epoxy to cure than fly a plane
    that looks rushed.
  </p>

    I take nothing for granted, even though the kit was partially started. I’m inspecting every assembly, completing all
    required modifications, and verifying what’s already done. You can see where these are documented in the Trim Tab and
    Right Horizontal Stabilizer sections.

    The engine choice is Aeromomentum—a company with decades of experience building airboat engines before moving into
    aviation. Their fuel-injected designs are based on proven automotive blocks, with proper ECU management.
    Let’s be honest: who’s had a car injection problem in the last 30 years? I’ve had more issues with aircraft engines
    than with cars.

    All control surfaces and systems will follow the manual. Ivan Shaw knew what he was doing when he designed the Europa.
    I’m not an aeronautical engineer—and I don’t want to be one. My job is to build it faithfully and safely.
  </p>

  <p>
    Sure, there are days when it feels like nothing’s happening, but progress is progress. As long as I’m moving forward,
    I’m happy.
